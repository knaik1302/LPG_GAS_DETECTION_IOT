# LPG_GAS_DETECTION_IOT
This is an IOT based LPG gas detection, alerting and taking proper precaution is an main objective of this project.
Here we are designing a system using gas sensors to detect the LPG gas
and working exhaust fan, window to avoid any hazardous situations. We
are a designing project that uses MQ5 gas detecting sensor to detect the
amount of LPG gas and alert the people around the LPG source using
buzzer and sending the notification to authorized user. We strive to build
this system that can avoid unfortunate circumstances.

The operational view is the implementation of the content mentioned in
the functional View specification. In this system we use an Arduino Uno
board to connect the system to the program. The different components
that we have used here are Arduino uno, bread board, MQ5 Gas sensor,
Led, Buzzer, Servo motor, DC motor, ESP8266 WIFI module, LCD.
Given below are the two circuit diagrams of our system, showing all the
connections of the components that we have listed before.

An MQ5 gas sensor is used. When the target combustible gas exists, the
sensor conductivity increases along with the rising gas concentration. The
MQ5 gas sensor has a high sensitivity to Propane, Butane and LPG, and
response to Natural gas. Here an MQ5 gas sensor is connected to an analog pin A1.

The LCDs have a parallel interface, meaning that the microcontroller has
to manipulate several interface pins at once to control the display. The
interface consists of the following pins: A register select (RS) pin,
Read/Write (R/W) pin, An Enable pin, 8 data pins (D0 -D7). There's also
a display contrast pin (Vo), power supply pins (+5V and Gnd) and LED
Backlight (Bklt+ and BKlt-) pins that you can use to power the LCD,
control the display contrast, and turn on and off the LED backlight,
respectively. Here we are connected RS pin, Enable pin and data pins
(D4, D5, D6, D7) to 12, 11, 5, 4, 3, 2 respectively.

Servo motor sweeps the shaft of a RC servo motor back and forth across
180 degrees. Servo motors have three wires: power, ground, and signal.
Signal wire is connected to pin number 9 of Arduino uno.

DC motor, LED and Buzzer are normally have just two leads, one
positive and one negative. In our system, all positive leads of DC motor,
LED and Buzzer are connected or made common to pin number 13.

ESP8266 WIFI module is used to communicate with the cloud. This
component Rx and Tx pin can be connected to pin numbers 6 and 7 of
Arduino uno respectively.

The gas sensor detects the amount of gas and that value is displayed on
the lcd screen. Based on the value of the gas detected, there are three
states Normal, Medium and Extreme. If the detected gas is in normal
state then no changes take place. If the gas is in medium state then the led
starts to blink, buzzer starts to work and the exhaust fan is started. When
the gas is in or exceeds the extreme state then the window is opened and
the notification to the user is sent. At last, when the gas completely goes
out (Normal state) then the window is closed and the exhaust fan stops
rotating.

WIFI module will make a TCP connection to ThingSpeak cloud using
API key which is generated by ThingSpeak cloud.

ThingSpeak cloud will send request to Pushbullet using ThingHTTP to
push the notification to user. For sending request to Pushbullet,
ThingHTTP need access token from Pushbullet. This Pushbullet app is
installed in Android application in order to receive notification.
