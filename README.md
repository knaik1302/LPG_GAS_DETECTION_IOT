# LPG_GAS_DETECTION_IOT
This is an IOT based LPG gas detection, alerting and taking proper precaution is an main objective of this project.
Here we are designing a system using gas sensors to detect the LPG gas
and working exhaust fan, window to avoid any hazardous situations. We
are a designing project that uses MQ5 gas detecting sensor to detect the
amount of LPG gas and alert the people around the LPG source using
buzzer and sending the notification to authorized user. We strive to build
this system that can avoid unfortunate circumstances.

The Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is a main source of fuel, especially
in urban areas because it is clean compared to firewood and charcoal. Gas
leakage is a major problem in the industrial sector, residential premises,
etc. Nowadays, home security has become a major issue because of
increasing gas leakage. Gas leakage is a source of great anxiety with
ateliers, residential areas and vehicles like Compressed Natural Gas
(CNG), buses, and cars which are run on gas power. One of the
preventive methods to stop accidents associated with the gas leakage is to
install a gas leakage detection kit at vulnerable places. Safety for all must
be insured in todayâ€™s world and it is necessary that efficient and proactive
safety systems should be implemented in households. The aim of this
project is to propose and discuss a design of a gas leakage detection
system that can automatically detect, alert and control gas leakage. This
proposed system also includes an alerting system for the users. The
system is based on a sensor that easily detects a gas leakage.
